# EquivaMap: Leveraging LLMs for Automatic Equivalence Checking of Optimization Formulations

This repository contains the code for our paper [EquivaMap: Leveraging LLMs for Automatic Equivalence Checking of Optimization Formulations](). Inspired by Karp reductions, in this work we introduce quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal criterion for determining when two optimization formulations are equivalent based on the existence of a mapping between their decision variables. We propose EquivaMap, a framework that leverages large language models to automatically discover such mappings, enabling scalable and reliable equivalence verification. To evaluate our approach, we construct the first open-source dataset of equivalent optimization formulations, generated by applying transformations such as adding slack variables or valid inequalities to existing formulations.
